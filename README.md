# Bookmarks

## User stories 
```
As a user 
So that I can visit my regular web pages faster
Iâ€™d like to be shown a list of my bookmarks

As a user 
I want to be able to add a bookmark 
So that I can easily access them later 

As a user 
I want to be able to delete a bookmark
So that I can remove it from my list

As a user
I want to be able to update a bookmark
So that I can keep my list up to date

```
